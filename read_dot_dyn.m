% X,Y,Z are matricies of X, Y, and Z node locations (initial)

% These matricies are part of the input to scat_and_disp.m

% Sort data in prepartion for formation of plaid 3D matricies
%
% This step generates matrix n2 which a "defuzzed" nodeloc
% the X,Y,Z components of X,Y,Z are truncated to TOL places after the 
% decimal.  The reason for this operation is to eliminate the 
% roundoff error differences between node coordinates (e.g. 1.499999
% is really 1.50000).  The "numerical fuzz" left behind by the float to 
% ascii conversion fouls up sorting and confounds the creation of plaid
% 3D matricies 
%

% X,Y,Z and selecting a thousandth of that, & TOL is log10 of 1/that

% node_loc now is sorted into the same order, preserving the orginal
